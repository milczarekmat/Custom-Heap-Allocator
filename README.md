# Custom-Heap-Allocator
The aim of this project was to create API for managing heap. For this purpose, I prepared my own versions of the malloc, calloc, free and realloc functions. 

In addition, I supplemented the whole with additional utility functions, allowing to status monitoring, consistency and defragmentation of the heap area.

The project was uploaded and checked with unit tests on this [site](https://dante.iis.p.lodz.pl/).
